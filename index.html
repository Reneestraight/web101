<p> Preston is happy, energetic, normal boy. He loves playing,
 jumping on the trampoline with his brothers and Toy Story.
 Just like any other boy he loves spending time with his family
  and laughs like crazy.  However, Preston has an indivisible 
  disease that is wreaking havoc inside of his body. </p>
